    <h1>The Best Movies According to Susi Martini</h1>
    <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
    <hr>

    <h3>Kimetsu no Yaiba: Mugen Train (2020)</h3>
    <p>This is my all-time favorite anime manga series film. 
        I love the song with the theme "Homura" sung by LiSA, 
        which conveys a sense of spirit, sacrifice, and loss.</p>

    <h3>Doctor Strange</h3>
    <p>My favorite Marvel movie. This film has very strong elements of fantasy 
        and science fiction because it explores other dimensions and manipulation of time and space. 
        The visual effects of this film are filled with mirror dimensions, which truly impressed me.</p>

    <h3>Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021)</h3>
    <p>My favorite movie. The science fiction elements appear through the very cool multiverse concept, 
        I like Peter Parker played by Tom Holland because he shows his true heroic side.</p>
